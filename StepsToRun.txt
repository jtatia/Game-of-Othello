Follow these steps to run the game : 

1: Install Python
2: Install pip
3: Install django
4: Unzip the downloaded assignment tgz into folder assign7
5: Go to assign7 folder 
6: Go to folder Othello [It contains the file manage.py] 
7: open terminal at this location and run the following :
   >>python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:<your_port> 
   // this creates a server at your system 
8: Now from any 2 systems (for the 2 players) open the following link : 
	<your system ip>:<your_port>
9: From one system create game. It will take you to the following : 
    <your system ip>:<your_port>/game/<token>/
10: From the second system click Join Existing Game. It will ask a token. Enter the token contained in the link as in step 9

e.g.)

Say your ip is 172.16.82.123 and you choose port 1234

Then go to folder containing manage.py and run the following : 

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:1234

then from player 1 system run the following in the browser : 

172.16.82.123:8000

then create game :

it redirects to say

172.16.82.123:8000/game/23/

then this means token is 23

Now, for another player open 

172.16.82.123:8000

then click join existing game and provide 23 as the game token.
Now both players can play the game. Player 2 is black and will get first chance.
